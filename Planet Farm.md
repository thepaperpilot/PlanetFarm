Planet Farm
---
Because god dammit I just can't get away from the space theme.

**Premise**:A game where you grow planets in the same way you would grow a farm. You buy farm seeds and plant them on asteroids and they grow into planets.

There are plots of space to grow planets in. There are different sized seeds for different sized planets/plots.

The planet will sometimes say random things, as if it were a child. Just something to see as time passes.

**Focus**
A gameplay driven game. Focus on:

 - Procedurally Generated planets [^1]
 - Simulating planet "reproduction" and genetically composing new planets

Also I want to try some new things with this game. I want to try to:

 - Make a game for web, desktop, and android
 - Make the game 3D! Spinning planets!
 - Game is saved (not like Space Game) [^2]

**Gameplay**
Player collects moons for seeds to make new planets. Cross pollinating animals allows you to design your own planets, in a way. The planets are grown in plots. There are different sized plots for different sized seeds/planets. 
Planets will grow and then die. While they're growing they produce the moons to be collected by the player. When they die the planet itself can be harvested for resources to use in the shop.
The shop sells some common planet seeds and animals.

> Note: This isn't some free to play game. There will be no microtransactions or any sort of monetization, and the game will be based around that. The different plot sizes will allow players to choose how often they want to play. 

As a general rule small plots grow/die quickly, and large plots grow/die slowly, producing slightly more gross resources, but nowhere near the same time:resources ratio. Also there's no penalty for not playing. e.g. moons don't expire.
